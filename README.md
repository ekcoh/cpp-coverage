# cpp-coverage

## Introduction
This project provides CMake functions to simplify running C++ tests with code 
coverage reports generated by [OpenCppCoverage](https://github.com/OpenCppCoverage/OpenCppCoverage).

## Usage

In order to use cpp-coverage to simplify usage of OpenCppCoverage, all you need 
to do is to make sure cpp-coverage is available to your build by fetching it, 
using fetch-content, external-project_add, submodule or similar. 
Then make sure cpp-coverage is added to your build by adding it as a subdirectory 
and finally use 'cpp_coverage_add_test_coverage' function to add test coverage 
based on existing test binary targets. The utility functions will create custom 
targets to generate coverage (.cov) files as well as custom targets to generate 
coverage reports (e.g. HTML). Coverage reports default to aggregated project 
coverage but additional options exist to for example also generate reports per 
test target. 

See /cmake/cpp_coverage.cmake documentation for complete list of supported options.

## Usage with test frameworks

Examples provided in this project are using Google Test but no good integration 
equivalent to gtest_discover_tests(...) currently exist. Only support for 
integration via CTest is currently provided as part of this project.

For complete examples, see /examples folder. Examples are not built by default 
and requires CPP_COVERAGE_BUILD_EXAMPLES to be set to ON.

See [OpenCppCoverage documentation](https://github.com/OpenCppCoverage/OpenCppCoverage/wiki) 
for details on how to use and integrate in CI etc.
