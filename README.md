# cpp-coverage

## Introduction
This project provides CMake functions to simplify running C++ tests with code 
coverage reports generated by [OpenCppCoverage](https://github.com/OpenCppCoverage/OpenCppCoverage).

## Usage

In order to use `cpp-coverage` to simplify usage of OpenCppCoverage, all you need 
to do is to make sure `cpp-coverage` is available to your build by fetching it, 
using fetch-content, external-project_add, submodule or similar. 
Then make sure `cpp-coverage` is added to your build by adding it as a subdirectory 
and finally use 'cpp_coverage_add_test' function to augment the regular cmake 
`add_test` function with coverage based on existing test binary targets. 
The utility functions will create custom targets to generate coverage (.cov) files 
as well as custom targets to generate coverage reports (e.g. HTML). Coverage reports 
default to aggregated project coverage but additional options exist to for example 
also generate reports per test target. 

See documentation of cmake functions in [cmake/cpp_coverage.cmake](cmake/cpp_coverage.cmake) 
for a complete list of supported options.

## Usage with test frameworks

Examples provided in this project are using Google Test in combination with CTest. 
Note that CTest support is similar to CMake `add_test`command.
Adding tests via e.g. `gtest_discover_tests(...)` is currently not supported. 

For complete examples, see [examples](examples) folder. Examples are not built by default 
and requires CPP_COVERAGE_BUILD_EXAMPLES to be set to ON.

See [OpenCppCoverage documentation](https://github.com/OpenCppCoverage/OpenCppCoverage/wiki) 
for details on how to use and integrate in CI etc.
